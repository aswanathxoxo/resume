        <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I’m Aswanath, and I’ve always been super into the tech world. As a kid, I loved taking apart old gadgets just to see what was inside. This curiosity turned into a real passion during my high school years when I studied computer science and learned how to program. This knowledge made me want to get a B.Tech in Computer Science. Every day is a new chance to learn something cool, and I wouldn’t trade this journey for anything!</p>

        <h2>What Keeps Me Going</h2>
        <p>In the rapidly evolving tech landscape, I’m eager to contribute to transformative forces. Data science and AI resonate with me because they can make a meaningful impact. I’m motivated to collaborate on creating innovative solutions that enhance lives. I’m committed to continuous professional development, acquiring specialized knowledge and solving complex challenges.</p>

        <h2>Beyond the Screen</h2>
        <p>In addition to my coding expertise, I possess a keen interest in actively seeking to stay informed by consuming international news. I firmly believe that maintaining a comprehensive understanding of global events not only broadens my horizons but also fosters a balanced perspective in both my personal and professional endeavors.</p>
